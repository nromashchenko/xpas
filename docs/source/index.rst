Check out the :doc:`install` and :doc:`usage` for further information.


.. warning::
   Although XCL (XPAS Core Library) is currently stable, it is still under development. 
   Therefore, future updates of the library may not be backward compatible. 
   Unfortunately, this means that databases built with the current version of XPAS 
   may not be compatible with the future versions of phylo-k-mer-based tools 
   (e.g., RAPPAS2_ and SHERPAS_). Check out the changelog_ for breaking changes.
