XPAS's documentation
===================================

XPAS (a recursive acronym for XPAS: Phylo-*k*-mers of Ancestral Sequences) is a
tool for creating phylo-*k*-mer databases. 

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.

.. note::

While XCL (XPAS Core Library) is currently stable, it is still under development. 
Therefore, future updates of the library may not be backward compatible. 
Unfortunately, this means that databases built with the current version of XPAS 
may not be compatible with the future versions of phylo-*k*-mer-based tools 
(e.g., RAPPAS2 and SHERPAS). Check out the changelog of XPAS for breaking changes.
